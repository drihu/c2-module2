# The execution of the method would be:
# First execution the block is provided the arguments 0 (initial value) and 2 (current value). It sums the values, returns 2.
# Second execution the block is provided the arguments 2 (last result) and 3 (current value). It sums the values and returns 5.
# Third execution the block is provided the arguments 5 (last result) and 4 (current value). It sums the values and returns 9.
# Forth execution the block is provided the arguments 9 (last result) and 5 (current value). It sums the values and returns 14.
# The last iteration returns 14, and that is the value that the method returns.
